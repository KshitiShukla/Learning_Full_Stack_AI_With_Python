# Learning_Full_Stack_AI_With_Python

## Complete AI & LLM Engineering Bootcamp Repository

**Hands-on guide to modern AI: Tokenization, Agents, RAG, Vector DBs, and deploying scalable AI apps.**

Welcome to the official code repository for the Complete AI & LLM Engineering Bootcamp. This course is your complete path to becoming a proficient AI Engineer, covering foundational development tools through to advanced, scalable LLM systems.

This is a strictly hands-on, project-based course. By the end, you will be able to code, deploy, and scale real-world AI applications using the same cutting-edge techniques that power models like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude.

## Course Overview: What You Will Learn

The bootcamp is designed to provide both deep theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills across the full AI engineering stack.

**1. Foundations & Modern Tooling**

- Python Programming: Master the language from scratch—syntax, data types, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and advanced features.

- Git & GitHub: Essentials for version control, including branching, merging, professional workflows, and collaboration.

- Docker: Learn containerization, images, volumes, and how to deploy applications like a professional engineer.

- Pydantic: Implement type-safe, structured data handling and validation for modern Python applications.

**2. AI Fundamentals & Transformers**

- LLM Mechanics: Understand what Large Language Models (LLMs) are and how models like GPT work under the hood.

- Core Concepts: Simple explanations of Tokenization, Embeddings, Attention, and Transformers.

- Deep Dive: Understanding multi-head attention, positional encodings, and the key insights from the "Attention is All You Need" paper.

**3. Prompt Engineering & LLM Integration**

- Prompt Mastery: Design effective prompts using advanced strategies: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, and persona-based prompts.

- Structured Outputs: Design prompts for reliable, structured outputs using Pydantic schemas.

- API Usage: Set up and integrate APIs from OpenAI and Gemini with Python.

- Local Deployment: Run and deploy models locally with Ollama + Docker and integrate Hugging Face models.

- FastAPI Integration: Connect LLMs to scalable FastAPI web endpoints.

**4. Agents & RAG Systems**

- AI Agents: Build your first sophisticated AI Agent from scratch, including CLI-based coding agents using Claude.

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Master the complete RAG pipeline: indexing, retrieval, and answering.

- LangChain: Utilize document loaders, splitters, retrievers, and vector stores with the LangChain framework.

- Scaling RAG: Implement advanced, scalable RAG systems using Redis/Valkey Queues for asynchronous processing, workers, and FastAPI.

**5. LangGraph & State Management**

- LangGraph: Introduction to LangGraph for designing stateful AI systems (state, nodes, edges, and graph-based AI).

- Memory Systems: Implement various memory layers: short-term, long-term, episodic, and semantic memory using Mem0 and Vector DBs.

- Data Persistence: Add checkpointing with MongoDB and implement Graph memory using Neo4j and Cypher queries.

**6. Conversational & Multi-Modal AI**

- Voice Agents: Build complete voice-based conversational agents, integrating Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS).

- AI Voice Assistant: Code your own AI voice assistant optimized for coding tasks (a Cursor IDE clone).

- Multi-Modal LLMs: Process images and text together for sophisticated AI applications.

- Model Context Protocol (MCP): Understand the importance of MCP and code an MCP server with Python for reliable transport via STDIO and SSE.

## Real-World Projects You'll Build

The repository contains code for highly practical, real-world applications:

1. Tokenizer from scratch.

2. Local Ollama + FastAPI AI app.

3. Python CLI-based coding assistant.

4. Document RAG pipeline with LangChain & Vector DB.

5. Queue-based scalable RAG system with Redis & FastAPI.

6. AI conversational voice agent (STT + GPT + TTS).

7. Graph memory agent with Neo4j.

8. MCP-powered AI server.

## Repository Notes on Missing Folders

We aim to provide all relevant code for the course. However, due to GitHub's file size limitations, some folders containing large model files, documentation sets, or extensive data required for specific modules have been omitted from this repository.

The following modules are excluded from the GitHub repository:

- 17_hf_basic (Hugging Face Models Basics)

- 19_rag (Core RAG Pipeline)

- 20_rag_queue (Queue-based Scalable RAG)

Please refer to the official course content or platform for the complete, self-contained zip files required to run these specific projects.

## Who Is This Course For?

- Beginners who want a complete, step-by-step path into Python, AI, and modern development.

- Developers who want to integrate LLMs, RAG, and Agents into real-world applications.

- Data Engineers/Backend Developers looking to upgrade their skills with modern AI-powered systems.

- Students & Professionals aiming to stand out in the job market with cutting-edge AI engineering knowledge.

**Prerequisites**

- No prior AI knowledge is required—we start from the basics.

- A computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux) with internet access.
